uls_merge_math.py
═════════════════
Pure-math core of the LoRA merge, factored out of uls_stack_node.py (v348) so it
carries NO ComfyUI import and is therefore unit-testable in isolation (see
tests/test_v348_merge_math.py). These functions were MOVED verbatim — same code,
new home — and re-imported back into uls_stack_node, so behaviour is unchanged.

Contents: convention detection / factor-key collection, DARE density+seed+mask
helpers, deterministic Trim channel selection, and the TIES RESOLVE sign-election
(_resolve_sign_elect). torch is imported lazily inside the functions, exactly as
before, so importing this module stays cheap and dependency-light.

    for ONE base layer.

    Each (B_f, A_f) pair is already weight/scale-folded (and, if Trim is on,
    already trimmed). Three steps:
      1. Elect a sign per weight element from the SUM of all per-LoRA deltas.
      2. Disjoint mean: average ONLY the LoRAs whose sign agrees with the elected
         one at that element; the sign-fighting contributions are dropped (this is
         what cuts the "many LoRAs cancel each other out" effect).
      3. Re-pack the resolved full delta as a LOW-RANK LoRA via a truncated
         randomized SVD (rank = sum of input ranks, i.e. CONCAT footprint), so the
         result rejoins the standard load_lora hand-off completely unchanged.

    v259 - device / dtype:
      * `device` selects where the heavy math runs ("cuda" or "cpu").
      * On CUDA the per-source delta matmuls (B @ A) run in fp16 (tensor cores)
        when `use_fp16`; the sign SUM, the disjoint MEAN and the SVD always run in
        fp32 for stability. The sign election only needs the sign, so the fp16
        matmul error is irrelevant there.
      * The resolved low-rank pair is moved back to CPU before return and every
        device temporary is freed, so VRAM stays flat across all layers.
      * CUDA OOM is intentionally NOT caught here - it propagates so the caller
        can retry the whole merge on CPU.

    v259 - single pass: each source delta is built ONCE and reused for both the
    sign election and the disjoint mean (v258 rebuilt it twice to cap memory). On
    the CPU-fp32 path this is bit-identical to v258 (same ops, same order, same
    seed), so CPU stays a byte-exact fallback for the GPU path. The SVD is seeded
    deterministically (RNG state saved/restored) so the merge is reproducible
    run-to-run on a given device, like the DARE path.

    Returns (B_merged, A_merged) on CPU, reshaped to the layer's factor shapes,
    None on full cancellation, or raises on a shape it cannot represent (caller
    falls back to SEQ) or on CUDA OOM (caller retries on CPU).
