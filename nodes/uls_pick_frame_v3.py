"""
Polyhedron Pick Frame — V3 schema edition.

This is the V3 (ComfyUI Nodes 2.0) form of ULSImagePickFrame, the companion to
ULSWanFrameInflate (see nodes/wan_frame_inflate.py). It is the FIRST node in the
pack migrated to the declarative comfy_api V3 schema, so it rides the Vue node
renderer instead of the legacy LiteGraph canvas path.

Registration: this class is collected by the pack's single V3 extension in
nodes/uls_v3_extension.py (which holds the one comfy_entrypoint). __init__.py
imports that entrypoint inside a try/except; if comfy_api.latest is unavailable,
the import fails, _V3_OK stays False, and every migrated node — including this
one — falls back to its legacy registration so nothing disappears.

The node id is kept IDENTICAL to the legacy key ("ULSImagePickFrame") so existing
saved workflows keep resolving the node unchanged. Because the id is shared, the
legacy and V3 forms are mutually exclusive (either/or), never both registered at
once — __init__.py enforces that via the central _V3_OK flag.

The execute() body is a verbatim port of the legacy pick() logic; behaviour is
identical (middle frame on -1, clamp otherwise, pass-through on an empty batch).
