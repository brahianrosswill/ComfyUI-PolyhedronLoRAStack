Polyhedron Wan Frame Inflate / Pick Frame

Workaround for kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper Issue #1827:
    LoRAs have no effect when sampling with frames=1 + fp8_scaled model.

The bug is in kijai's CustomLinear / set_lora_params pipeline, which only
fires the LoRA forward path correctly when the latent has more than one
temporal frame (T > 1). At T == 1 the LoRAs load without errors but their
effect is invisible.

This pair of nodes works around the bug WITHOUT modifying kijai's code:

  • ULSWanFrameInflate  — sits between WanVideoEmptyEmbeds (or any embeds
    source) and WanVideoSampler. It bumps target_shape[1] from 1 to N
    latent frames (default 5, → 17 video frames at VAE_STRIDE=4) so the
    sampler runs in video mode and LoRAs become active.

  • ULSImagePickFrame  — sits after WanVideoDecode. Picks one frame from
    the decoded batch (default: middle frame, which the sampler tends to
    converge on best in short multi-frame runs).

Cost: sampling time roughly 2x a single-frame run (self-attention scales
sub-linearly with frame count for tiny T). VAE decode time is negligible
for 5 frames vs 1 frame at typical resolutions.

If kijai fixes Issue #1827 upstream, both nodes can be removed without
changing the rest of the workflow.
