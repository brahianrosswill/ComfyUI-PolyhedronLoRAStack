"""test_v657_listing_race -- the drop-vs-focus listing race, DRIVEN.

The field wound (v655 regression): dropping a file from the Explorer gives
the window focus, the silent focus probe starts and fetches a PRE-upload
listing; the upload's own re-read applies the fresh listing and selects the
new tile; then the probe's stale response lands, "differs" by signature,
overwrites the listing and the new tile vanishes -- first drop "didn't
take", the second sat inside the 5 s debounce and worked.

What runs:
  * _focusReread DRIVEN VERBATIM under node with a controllable fetch:
      - stale scenario: while the probe's fetch is in flight, a newer
        listing fetch takes a ticket (this._listSeq bumps, exactly what
        refreshGrid does) -> the probe's response must be DROPPED (files
        untouched, no render);
      - fresh scenario: no newer ticket -> the changed listing applies;
      - busy scenario: _busyCount > 0 -> the probe never even fetches.
    node absent -> that half is SKIP-AS-PASS.
  * statics: BOTH listing fetches take a ticket (exactly two bumps of
    _listSeq), both check their ticket after the await, the busy
    suppression line exists.

MUTATIONS (wound injected into a COPY, catch proven): M1 the probe loses
its ticket check (the race returns -- driven catch), M2 the busy
suppression falls (static), M3 refreshGrid loses its ticket bump (the
probe's ticket can never go stale -- static count).
